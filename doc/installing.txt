= Installing vpd

== Building from sources

=== distribution specific libraries

Instal required packages following your distribution.

==== raspbian

    sudo apt-get install cmake
    sudo apt-get install libicu-dev

.Note
libboost version 1.54 or later is required

==== archlinux ARM

TODO

==== all distributions

If your linux distribution do not provide an enough recent version of libboost (e.g. version >1.54), then you should
install boost libraries from the sources. Follow the instructions given on the boost.org site:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/index.html

.Notes
- Don't forget to install libicu prior to building the boost libraries
- The building process of the boost libraries can take a whil, especially on the Raspberry PI systems

=== build vpd

    git clone <TODO put link to git repo here>
    cd vpd
    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
