= Why start a new video player?

Well, vpd is not really a video player. Instead, it uses well established and awesome vlc to render the videos. However,
vlc lacks a remote capable daemon mode, and that's vpd's job!

= Why did you start this project?

I started this project when I realized that I cannot find a suitable media center capable of playing nicely with my
HiFiBerry and with the Raspberry PI B+'s video decoding hardware at the same time. vlc actually can do that but it's
remote capabilities are somewhat limited. Besides, I recently switched to mpd and find it's capabilities really awesome.
I wanted the same for my video streams and files.
