= Installing vpd

== Building from sources

=== distribution specific libraries

Instal required packages following your distribution.

==== raspbian wheezy

    sudo apt-get install cmake
    sudo apt-get install libicu-dev libarchive-dev


.Notes
- vpd uses C++14 features, and it needs GCC 4.9. If that's not provided by your system, then you'll need to install GCC4.9. See instructions below.
- libboost version 1.54 or later is required. If they are not provided, then you'll need to build boost libraries from the sources. See below.

===== Installing GCC 4.9

Raspbian comes with a rather old GCC version. So you may want to follow the instructions below to get the 4.9 version.

.Note
Users of the HiFiBerry card will also need to update the kernel modules and reapply the modules configuration. Please see this:

==== archlinux ARM

TODO

.Note
- I'm not using this distribution, so please feel free to complete it and send me a patch!

==== Building boost libraries from source

If your linux distribution do not provide an enough recent version of libboost (e.g. version >1.54), then you should
install boost libraries from the sources. Follow the instructions given on the boost.org site:
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/index.html

Plase ensure you're using GCC 4.9 or latest before building boost libraires.

When selecting libraries, please use this command line:
    ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=chrono,date_time,exception,filesystem,iostreams,locale,log,program_options,system,thread,timer

.Notes
- Don't forget to install libicu prior to building the boost libraries
- The building process of the boost libraries can take a whil, especially on the Raspberry PI systems

=== build vpd

    git clone <TODO put link to git repo here>
    cd vpd
    mkdir build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
