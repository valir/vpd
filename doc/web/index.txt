Posted: February 02, 2015

OK, I decided to get a shiny new domain for vpd and fortunately the .io domain was readily available! I took no chance
and reserved it right away.

vpd is a new project. Help is definitely needed in the following areas:

- translating this website
- adding an android remote
- adding an iPhone/iOS remote
- adding an Windows Phone remote

== Donating

I'm doing this project in my free/spare time. I also run a custom domain and a small server for the web hosting. If
you'd like me to put more time in it, then why not consider donating? Any amount is welcome!
